# Maintenance Checklist

Concise recurring checklist for meta-system maintenance and validation.

## Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Verify all `/meta` files conform to structure and naming standards

## Optional Usage Index Maintenance

AI tools may maintain a simple usage index automatically for user clarity:

- **High-Touch Documents**: Frequently accessed/updated files (changelog, session notes, active PRDs)
- **Medium-Touch Documents**: Periodically updated files (architecture docs, API specs, testing docs)
- **Low-Touch Documents**: Static reference files (glossary, standards, historical records)

This index helps users understand which documentation files require regular attention versus those that serve as reference material.
