# Governance

The Governance layer represents the system's self-governance and amendment mechanism within the AI-Native Meta Documentation System. This layer defines how the meta documentation maintains, evolves, and validates itself over time, ensuring continuity and stability while allowing controlled iteration.

## Purpose

Governance defines how the constitution changes over time, providing the "judicial" logic that determines how updates occur, who or what approves them, how versioning is tracked, and how the system checks itself for decay or drift. This layer ensures that the meta system remains authoritative, consistent, and self-maintaining across all projects and use cases.

## Core Components

- **[Evolution Guide](evolution-guide.md)** - Amendment process and constitutional change procedures
- **[Maintenance Checklist](maintenance-checklist.md)** - Routine self-audit tasks and validation procedures
- **[Meta Changelog](meta-changelog.md)** - Historical record of meta-level changes and amendments
- **[Version](version.md)** - Meta system version tracking and compatibility information

## Authority Statement

No change within this system is legitimate unless recorded or authorized through the governance process. All modifications to meta-layer rules, frameworks, or operational procedures must follow the established amendment process and be documented in the meta changelog to maintain system integrity and traceability.
