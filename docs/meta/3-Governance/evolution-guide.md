## Purpose

Evolution is necessary to maintain the meta system's relevance, effectiveness, and alignment with changing requirements while preserving its constitutional authority and structural integrity.

## Article I — Proposal

1. **Technical Review** - Proposed changes must be reviewed for technical feasibility and consistency with existing meta principles
2. **Constitutional Compliance** - All amendments must align with foundational principles and maintain system orthogonality
3. **Cross-Reference Validation** - Changes must be validated against all affected cross-references and dependencies
4. **Template Compatibility** - Proposed changes must ensure compatibility with existing framework templates
