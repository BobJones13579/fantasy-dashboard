# Philosophy

The constitutional principles and axioms that govern the AI-Native Meta Documentation System.

## Principle 1 – Simplicity is Law

All documentation must prioritize clarity and simplicity over comprehensive coverage. Complex systems require simple documentation interfaces that can be understood and maintained by both AI agents and human operators. This principle ensures that the meta system remains accessible and manageable as it scales.

## Principle 2 – Everything is Addressable

Every document, section, and concept within the meta system must have a unique, stable identifier that can be referenced and linked. This principle enables reliable cross-referencing, automated navigation, and consistent AI agent behavior across the documentation ecosystem.

## Principle 3 – Layers Are Orthogonal

The meta system's layered architecture (0-Foundations, 1-Frameworks, 2-Operations, 3-Governance, 4-Adaptations) maintains strict separation of concerns. Each layer serves a distinct purpose and cannot directly depend on higher-numbered layers, ensuring modularity and preventing circular dependencies.

## Principle 4 – Self-Similarity

The meta system exhibits self-similar patterns at all scales, from individual documents to complete documentation ecosystems. This principle enables consistent structure, predictable behavior, and scalable application of documentation patterns across projects of any size.

## Principle 5 – Self-Governance

The meta system must be capable of maintaining and evolving itself through automated processes and clear governance protocols. This principle ensures that the system can adapt to changing requirements while maintaining its core structural integrity and philosophical foundations.

## Principle 6 – Deterministic Hierarchy

All documentation follows a deterministic hierarchical structure that enables predictable navigation and automated processing. This principle ensures that AI agents can reliably locate, parse, and generate documentation according to established patterns and conventions.
