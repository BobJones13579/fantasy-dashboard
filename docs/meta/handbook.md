# Documentation Handbook

**TL;DR** — Documentation standards and principles for AI-assisted development following metadocs constitutional framework.

## Core Principles

- **Assume AI Intelligence** — Cursor knows common concepts; only document what's unique to your project
- **Be Concise** — Every sentence must add value; skip obvious explanations
- **TL;DR Required** — One-sentence summary for every document
- **Plain Markdown** — No fancy formatting, just clear structure

## What NOT to Document

- Universal programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Standard framework features (React components, API endpoints)
- Obvious implementation details (error handling, validation)
- Common best practices (code organization, naming conventions)

## What TO Document

- Project-specific business logic and requirements
- Custom implementations and architectural decisions
- Integration patterns unique to your system
- Domain-specific terminology and concepts

## Document Structure

### Required Elements
- **Title** — Single H1 header with clear, descriptive document name
- **TL;DR** — One-sentence summary for quick understanding
- **Body** — Structured sections with clear hierarchical organization

### Optional Elements
- **Purpose** — Brief statement of document's objective (only if not obvious)
- **Context** — Background information (only if essential for understanding)

## Writing Guidelines

### Content Standards
- Use H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections
- Maintain logical flow from high-level concepts to detailed implementation
- Include code blocks, tables, and examples as needed
- Focus on building the app, not explaining programming basics

### AI Optimization
- Structure content for AI agent consumption
- Use consistent terminology and patterns
- Provide clear cross-references between related documents
- Include actionable information, not theoretical concepts

## Enforcement

All AI agents must follow these standards when generating or updating project documentation.
