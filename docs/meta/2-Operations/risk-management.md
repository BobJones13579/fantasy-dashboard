# Risk Management

Comprehensive guardrails and safety protocols for AI-assisted development to prevent catastrophes and ensure system stability.

## Purpose

This document establishes mandatory risk management protocols that AI agents must follow when working with APIs, databases, deployments, and system integrations to prevent catastrophic failures and ensure safe, reliable development practices.

## Critical Risk Categories

### API Integration Risks
1. **Rate Limiting** - AI must always implement rate limiting and retry logic for API calls
2. **Authentication Security** - AI must never hardcode credentials or expose API keys
3. **Data Validation** - AI must validate all API responses and handle malformed data gracefully
4. **Version Compatibility** - AI must verify API versions and handle deprecation warnings
5. **Error Handling** - AI must implement comprehensive error handling for all API failures

### Database & Data Risks
6. **Schema Validation** - AI must validate data against schemas before database operations
7. **Migration Safety** - AI must create reversible migrations and test them in staging
8. **Query Optimization** - AI must analyze query performance and add necessary indexes
9. **Data Backup** - AI must ensure data is backed up before any destructive operations
10. **Transaction Integrity** - AI must use proper transaction handling for data consistency

### Security Risks
11. **Credential Management** - AI must use environment variables and secure credential storage
12. **Input Sanitization** - AI must sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
13. **Access Control** - AI must implement proper authentication and authorization
14. **CORS Configuration** - AI must configure CORS policies appropriately for security
15. **Secret Rotation** - AI must implement credential rotation and expiration policies

### Deployment & Infrastructure Risks
16. **Environment Isolation** - AI must never deploy to production without staging validation
17. **Resource Monitoring** - AI must implement monitoring for memory, CPU, and disk usage
18. **Service Dependencies** - AI must map and validate all service dependencies
19. **Rollback Capability** - AI must ensure all changes can be rolled back safely
20. **Health Checks** - AI must implement comprehensive health checks for all services

## Mandatory Safety Protocols

### Before Any Code Changes
- [ ] **Backup Verification** - Confirm backups are current and accessible
- [ ] **Staging Deployment** - Deploy and test changes in staging environment
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis** - Map all affected services and dependencies
- [ ] **Rollback Plan** - Document exact rollback procedures
- [ ] **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential failure points and mitigation strategies

### During Development
- [ ] **Incremental Changes** - Make small, testable changes rather than large modifications
- [ ] **Validation Gates** - Implement validation at each step of the process
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Test performance impact of changes
- [ ] **Security Review** - Verify security implications of all changes

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] **Staging Validation** - Confirm all functionality works in staging
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks** - Verify performance meets requirements
- [ ] **Security Scan** - Run security scans and vulnerability assessments
- [ ] **Monitoring Setup** - Ensure monitoring and alerting are in place
- [ ] **Rollback Testing** - Test rollback procedures in staging

## Emergency Response Protocols

### When Things Go Wrong
1. **Immediate Assessment** - Quickly assess the scope and impact of the issue
2. **Communication** - Notify relevant stakeholders immediately
3. **Rollback Decision** - Decide whether to rollback or fix forward
4. **Data Protection** - Ensure no data loss occurs during incident response
5. **Documentation** - Document the incident and lessons learned

### Recovery Procedures
1. **System Restoration** - Restore system to last known good state
2. **Data Validation** - Verify data integrity after restoration
3. **Service Verification** - Confirm all services are functioning correctly
4. **Performance Validation** - Ensure system performance is acceptable
5. **Incident Analysis** - Conduct post-incident analysis and improvement planning

## AI-Specific Risk Mitigation

### Code Generation Safety
- **Template Validation** - AI must use approved templates and patterns
- **Code Review** - AI must flag complex or risky code for human review
- **Testing Requirements** - AI must generate appropriate tests for all code
- **Documentation** - AI must document all code changes and their rationale

### Decision Making Boundaries
- **Human Escalation** - AI must escalate decisions with high risk or uncertainty
- **Confirmation Gates** - AI must get explicit confirmation for risky operations
- **Alternative Analysis** - AI must present multiple options with risk assessments
- **Conservative Approach** - AI must choose the safest option when in doubt

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Required Monitoring
- **System Health** - CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Application Metrics** - Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Database Performance** - Query performance, connection pools, lock contention
- **API Health** - Response times, error rates, rate limit usage
- **Security Events** - Failed logins, suspicious activity, policy violations

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical Alerts** - System down, data corruption, security breach
- **Warning Alerts** - Performance degradation, high error rates
- **Info Alerts** - Deployment success, configuration changes
- **Escalation Procedures** - Clear escalation paths for different alert types

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Requirements
- **Change Tracking** - All changes must be logged with rationale
- **Access Logging** - All system access must be logged and monitored
- **Data Lineage** - Track data flow and transformations
- **Compliance Checks** - Regular compliance validation against standards

### Documentation Requirements
- **Risk Register** - Maintain updated risk register with mitigation strategies
- **Incident Reports** - Document all incidents and lessons learned
- **Change Logs** - Maintain detailed logs of all system changes
- **Recovery Procedures** - Keep recovery procedures updated and tested
