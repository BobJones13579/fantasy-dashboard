# Orchestration Guide

How multiple prompts interact as chains and execution flows within the meta documentation system.

## Purpose

Chain prompts coordinate multiple AI operations to achieve complex documentation tasks through structured, sequential execution with defined inputs, outputs, and validation criteria.

## Generation Flow

```
Meta → Frameworks → Operations → Docs → Context
  ↓        ↓          ↓         ↓       ↓
Principles → Templates → Protocols → Content → Validation
```

## Step 1 – Initialize Context

1. Load meta system specifications and frameworks
2. Identify target project context and requirements
3. Establish source hierarchy and validation criteria
4. Set up cross-reference tracking and metadata preservation

## Step 2 – Select Chain Prompt

1. Determine appropriate chain prompt based on task type
2. Validate input requirements and available context
3. Confirm template compliance and scope boundaries
4. Initialize execution environment and logging

## Step 3 – Execute Chain Sequence

1. Follow chain prompt steps in defined order
2. Validate each step output before proceeding
3. Maintain cross-reference integrity throughout execution
4. Preserve metadata and version information

## Step 4 – Validate Output

1. Verify all outputs conform to framework templates
2. Check cross-reference integrity and completeness
3. Validate against source hierarchy and specifications
4. Confirm acceptance criteria are met

## Step 5 – Finalize and Report

1. Generate execution summary and compliance report
2. Update metadata and version tracking
3. Log any deviations or exceptions encountered
4. Provide next steps and follow-up recommendations
