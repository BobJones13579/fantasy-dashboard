# FAAB/Waiver Bid Predictor - Product Requirements Document

## TLDR

Strategic intelligence tool that analyzes historical free-agent auction data and provides optimal bid recommendations for waiver wire pickups, transforming bidding from guesswork into data-driven strategy.

## Purpose

This document defines the requirements and specifications for the FAAB/Waiver Bid Predictor feature in the Fantasy Football Companion App.

## Context

The FAAB/Waiver Bid Predictor is a strategic intelligence feature that provides competitive advantage in waiver wire bidding. This feature is part of Phase 3 development and depends on the core infrastructure and odds board from previous phases.

## Problem Statement

Fantasy football managers struggle with FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget) bidding decisions, often overpaying for players or missing out on valuable pickups due to poor bid strategy. Traditional fantasy platforms provide no guidance on optimal bid amounts, leaving managers to rely on gut feelings and incomplete information. League-specific bidding patterns and market dynamics are not analyzed or communicated to users.

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- Provide data-driven FAAB bid recommendations
- Analyze league-specific bidding behavior and patterns
- Track market trends and inflation in waiver wire
- Give users strategic advantage in waiver wire competition

### Success Criteria
- 70% of users follow bid recommendations weekly
- 25% improvement in FAAB efficiency (value per dollar spent)
- 90% of users find recommendations helpful
- 4.5+ user satisfaction rating for bid accuracy
- 80% of users check FAAB predictions before bidding
