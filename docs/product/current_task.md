# Current Task

**TL;DR** — Documentation system migration from complex 6-layer structure to simplified 3-section template-based approach.

## Active Development Focus

### Current Phase
**Documentation Migration** — Complete overhaul of documentation system

### Current Sprint
**Week 1** — Structure setup and content migration

## Immediate Tasks

### In Progress
- [ ] **Documentation Migration** — Migrating from 0-Overview through 5-Prompts to Product/Engineering/Meta structure
- [ ] **Content Condensation** — Removing verbose explanations and redundant information
- [ ] **Template Implementation** — Using meta-docs-template as foundation

### Next Up
- [ ] **Engineering Documentation** — Migrate architecture, API, and technical docs
- [ ] **Meta Documentation** — Migrate templates and standards
- [ ] **Configuration Update** — Update mkdocs.yml for new navigation

## Development Status

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: 0%

**Blockers**:
- [ ] Documentation system migration must complete first
- [ ] Development environment setup pending
- [ ] Supabase project creation needed
- [ ] ESPN API credentials configuration required

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: 0%

### Phase 3: Strategic Intelligence (Weeks 9-12)
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: 0%

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Weeks 13-16)
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: 0%

## Current Blockers

### Documentation Migration
- [ ] Complete product documentation migration
- [ ] Complete engineering documentation migration
- [ ] Complete meta documentation migration
- [ ] Test new structure and navigation

### Development Setup
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Configure ESPN API integration
- [ ] Set up initial codebase structure

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Documentation Migration** — Finish migrating all content to new structure
2. **Validate New Structure** — Test navigation and ensure no information lost
3. **Begin Development Setup** — Start Phase 1 development tasks
4. **Set Up Development Environment** — Prepare for actual development work

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All critical information preserved in new documentation structure
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive and logical
- [ ] Content is concise and AI-optimized
- [ ] No broken links or missing references
- [ ] Ready to begin Phase 1 development
