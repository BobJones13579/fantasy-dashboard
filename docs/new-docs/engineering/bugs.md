## Known Issues

### ISS-001: ESPN API Cookie Expiration
**Category**: API | **Severity**: High | **Status**: Known Issue

**Description**: ESPN API cookies expire periodically, causing authentication failures.

**Workaround**: Users can obtain new cookies from ESPN website, clear browser cache and re-authenticate.

**Planned Resolution**: Implement automatic cookie refresh mechanism (Phase 2, Week 6).

### ISS-002: Real-Time Updates on Slow Connections
**Category**: RealTime | **Severity**: Medium | **Status**: Known Issue

**Description**: Real-time updates may be delayed or fail on slow internet connections.

**Workaround**: Refresh the page manually, use the "Refresh" button in the app.

**Planned Resolution**: Implement connection quality detection and fallback to polling (Phase 2, Week 7).

### ISS-003: Mobile Performance on Older Devices
**Category**: Frontend | **Severity**: Medium | **Status**: Known Issue

**Description**: App may perform slowly on older mobile devices during odds updates.

**Workaround**: Close other apps to free up memory, use newer devices when possible.

**Planned Resolution**: Implement performance optimization for older devices (Phase 4, Week 13).

### ISS-004: Database Query Performance
**Category**: Database | **Severity**: Low | **Status**: Known Issue

**Description**: Some database queries may be slow when processing large amounts of historical data.

**Workaround**: Use pagination to limit data displayed, filter data by date range.

**Planned Resolution**: Implement database query optimization and proper indexing (Phase 4, Week 13).

### ISS-005: Browser Compatibility Issues
**Category**: Frontend | **Severity**: Low | **Status**: Known Issue

**Description**: App may not work properly on older browsers or browsers with JavaScript disabled.

**Workaround**: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), enable JavaScript.

**Planned Resolution**: Implement browser compatibility testing and fallback (Phase 4, Week 14).

## Error Log

### ERR-001: ESPN API Authentication Failure
**Date**: 2024-01-15 | **Severity**: High | **Component**: ESPN Integration | **Status**: Resolved

**Description**: Users unable to authenticate with ESPN API using provided cookies.

**Root Cause**: ESPN API requires both espn_s2 and SWID cookies, but users were only providing one or the other.

**Resolution**: 
- Updated authentication flow to require both cookies
- Added cookie validation before API calls
- Implemented cookie refresh mechanism

**Prevention**: Implement cookie expiration checking and user guidance for obtaining correct cookies.

### ERR-002: Database Connection Timeout
**Date**: 2024-01-15 | **Severity**: Critical | **Component**: Database | **Status**: Resolved

**Description**: Database connections timing out during peak usage, causing application failures.

**Root Cause**: Connection pool was not properly configured for the expected load.

**Resolution**: 
- Increased connection pool size from 10 to 50
- Implemented connection timeout settings
- Added connection health checks

**Prevention**: Monitor connection pool usage and set up alerts for connection pool exhaustion.

### ERR-003: Real-Time Update Failure
**Date**: 2024-01-15 | **Severity**: Medium | **Component**: Real-Time Updates | **Status**: Resolved

**Description**: WebSocket connections dropping unexpectedly, causing users to miss real-time updates.

**Root Cause**: WebSocket connections were not properly handling network interruptions.

**Resolution**: 
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection
- Added connection state monitoring
- Implemented heartbeat mechanism

**Prevention**: Implement robust WebSocket connection management and test network interruption scenarios.
