## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We needed to select a technology stack for a fantasy football companion app that would handle real-time data, betting operations, and strategic intelligence features. The app needs to be mobile-first, performant, and scalable.

#### Decision
Selected the following technology stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Caching**: Redis

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- React.js provides excellent mobile-first development capabilities
- FastAPI offers high performance and automatic API documentation
- Supabase provides real-time features out of the box
- TypeScript ensures type safety and better developer experience

**Negative**:
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with the stack
- Potential vendor lock-in with Supabase
- Additional complexity with multiple deployment platforms

### ADR-002: Token-Based Betting System
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We needed to create a betting system that provides excitement without handling real money, avoiding gambling regulations while maintaining engagement.

#### Decision
Implement a token-based betting system where:
- Each user receives 1000 tokens per week
- Tokens reset every Thursday morning
- All betting is done with virtual tokens only
- No real money is involved in any transactions

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Avoids gambling regulations and legal complications
- Provides betting excitement without financial risk
- Simple to implement and manage
- Clear user understanding of the system

**Negative**:
- May reduce engagement compared to real money betting
- Requires careful balance of token economics
- Potential for users to not take bets seriously

### ADR-003: ESPN API Integration Approach
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We need to integrate with fantasy football league data. ESPN is the primary platform for our target users, but the official API is limited and unofficial APIs are available.

#### Decision
Use the unofficial `espn-api` Python library with manual authentication:
- Users provide espn_s2 and SWID cookies for authentication
- Read-only access to league data
- Robust error handling for API instability
- Caching layer to reduce API calls

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Access to comprehensive league data
- No need for official API approval process
- Flexible data access for all required features

**Negative**:
- Unofficial API may break or change without notice
- Manual authentication process for users
- Potential legal/terms of service concerns
- Requires robust error handling and fallbacks

### ADR-004: Real-Time Updates Architecture
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
The app needs real-time updates for odds, scores, and betting activity to maintain engagement during live games.

#### Decision
Implement real-time updates using:
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for database changes
- WebSocket connections for live data
- 30-second refresh cycle for odds updates
- Event-driven architecture for notifications

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Provides engaging real-time experience
- Leverages Supabase's built-in real-time capabilities
- Scalable architecture for multiple users
- Automatic reconnection and error handling

**Negative**:
- Increased complexity in state management
- Higher resource usage for real-time connections
- Potential performance issues with many concurrent users
- Requires careful handling of connection states

### ADR-005: Mobile-First Design Approach
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
Target users primarily use mobile devices for fantasy football management, and the app should be optimized for phone usage.

#### Decision
Implement mobile-first design with:
- Touch-friendly interface (44px minimum touch targets)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Optimized performance for mobile devices

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Better user experience for primary use case
- PWA capabilities provide app-like experience
- Responsive design works across all devices
- Touch-optimized interface improves usability

**Negative**:
- Additional development complexity for responsive design
- May limit desktop-specific features
- Requires careful testing across multiple devices
- PWA features add complexity to deployment

### ADR-006: Database Schema Design
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We need a database schema that supports users, leagues, teams, matchups, odds, bets, and historical data for analytics.

#### Decision
Design PostgreSQL schema with:
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Indexes for query performance
- Real-time enabled tables

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Flexible schema supports complex data relationships
- JSONB provides flexibility for varying data structures
- UUIDs ensure global uniqueness
- Proper indexing improves query performance

**Negative**:
- JSONB queries can be more complex
- UUIDs use more storage space than integers
- Requires careful index management
- Complex relationships may impact performance

### ADR-007: Authentication and Authorization
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We need secure user authentication and authorization for league members to access their specific league data.

#### Decision
Implement authentication using:
- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- League-based authorization (users can only access their leagues)
- Role-based access control (admin, member, viewer)
- Secure session management

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Leverages Supabase's built-in authentication
- JWT tokens provide stateless authentication
- League-based authorization ensures data privacy
- Role-based access provides flexibility

**Negative**:
- JWT tokens cannot be revoked easily
- Requires careful token management
- League-based authorization adds complexity
- Potential security issues if tokens are compromised

### ADR-008: API Design and Versioning
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We need a well-designed API that can evolve over time while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Decision
Design REST API with:
- RESTful principles and HTTP methods

- OpenAPI documentation generation
- Consistent error responses
- Rate limiting and validation

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- RESTful design is familiar and well-understood
- Versioning allows for API evolution
- Auto-generated documentation reduces maintenance
- Consistent patterns improve developer experience

**Negative**:
- Versioning adds complexity to maintenance
- REST may not be optimal for all use cases

- Flexible caching strategy for different data types

**Negative**:
- Adds complexity to data consistency
- Cache invalidation can be challenging
- Requires additional infrastructure (Redis)
- Potential for stale data if not managed properly

### ADR-010: Error Handling and Logging
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15

#### Context
We need robust error handling and logging for debugging, monitoring, and user experience.

#### Decision
Implement comprehensive error handling:
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Error tracking and monitoring
- Automatic retry mechanisms

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Better debugging and troubleshooting capabilities
