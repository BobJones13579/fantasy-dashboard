## Development Philosophy

### "Use, Don't Build" Strategy
The project prioritizes leveraging existing solutions over custom implementations:

1. **Leverage Existing Solutions** - Use proven libraries and APIs instead of building from scratch
2. **Focus on Integration** - Spend time integrating existing solutions rather than building new ones
3. **Community-Driven** - Utilize open-source solutions with active communities
4. **Cost-Effective** - Prioritize free tiers and open-source solutions

### Free-First Approach
- **Total Monthly Cost**: $0/month using free tiers
- **All MVP requirements** can be met with free tiers
- **Fallback options** available for paid services if needed

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for mobile-first responsive design
- **UUI** component library (free, open source)
- **Socket.IO** for real-time communication
- **Vercel** for deployment (free tier)

### Backend
- **FastAPI** (Python) for high-performance API
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) with real-time subscriptions
- **NumPy/SciPy** for Monte Carlo simulations
- **The Odds API** for sports betting odds
- **Yahoo Fantasy API** for cross-platform fantasy data
- **Redis** for caching (free tier available)
