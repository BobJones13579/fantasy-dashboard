**Root Cause**: 
Race condition in token balance updates when multiple bets were placed simultaneously. Database transactions were not properly isolated.

**Resolution**: 
- Implemented database transactions for token operations
- Added atomic balance updates
- Implemented balance validation before bet placement
- Added balance reconciliation process

**Prevention**: 
- Always use database transactions for financial operations
- Implement proper concurrency control

**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: Frontend
**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 
App performance significantly degraded on mobile devices, especially during odds updates.

**Root Cause**: 
Large amounts of data being processed on the client side, causing UI blocking and poor performance on mobile devices.

**Resolution**: 
- Implemented data pagination for large datasets
- Added virtual scrolling for long lists
- Optimized React component rendering
- Implemented data caching and memoization

**Prevention**: 
- Always consider mobile performance during development
- Implement data pagination and virtualization
- Optimize React component performance
