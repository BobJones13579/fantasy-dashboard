# Documentation Migration Plan

## TLDR

Complete overhaul of documentation system using meta-docs-template to condense and simplify the current elaborate structure.

## Migration Overview

### Current State
- **Complex Structure**: 0-Overview, 1-Product, 2-Design, 3-Development, 4-Debugging, 5-Prompts
- **Verbose Content**: 500+ line files with redundant explanations
- **Convoluted Navigation**: Too many layers and subdirectories

### Target State
- **Simplified Structure**: Product, Engineering, Meta (3 main sections)
- **Condensed Content**: Essential information only, AI-optimized
- **Clear Navigation**: Logical grouping with minimal hierarchy

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure Setup
1. **Create New Structure**: Set up product/, engineering/, meta/ folders
2. **Copy Templates**: Use meta-docs-template as foundation
3. **Update Configuration**: Modify mkdocs.yml for new navigation

### Phase 2: Content Migration
1. **Product Documentation**: Condense roadmap, PRDs, features into product/ section
2. **Engineering Documentation**: Consolidate architecture, API, data models into engineering/ section
3. **Meta Documentation**: Migrate templates and standards to meta/ section

### Phase 3: Content Condensation
1. **Apply AI Standards**: Remove verbose explanations, focus on essentials
2. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove duplicate information across files
3. **Optimize for AI**: Structure content for AI agent consumption

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. **Test Navigation**: Verify all links work in new structure
2. **Validate Content**: Ensure no critical information lost
3. **AI Testing**: Verify AI can effectively use new structure

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. **Remove Old Structure**: Delete 0-Overview through 5-Prompts folders
2. **Update References**: Fix any remaining links to old structure
3. **Final Validation**: Complete system test

## Content Mapping

### Product Section
- **vision.md**: Project goals, success criteria (from roadmap.md)
- **overview.md**: System modules, tech stack (from architecture-overview.md)
- **backlog.md**: Feature tracking (from backlog.md, milestones.md)
- **current_task.md**: Active development focus (from implementation-status.md)

### Engineering Section
- **architecture.md**: System design (from system-architecture.md, backend.md, frontend.md)
- **changelog.md**: Version history (from changelog.md)
- **bugs.md**: Issue tracking (from known-issues.md, error-log.md)
- **decisions.md**: ADRs (from architecture-decisions.md)

### Meta Section
- **handbook.md**: Documentation standards (from ai-documentation-standards.md)
- **glossary.md**: Terminology (from glossary.md)
- **templates/**: Document blueprints (from existing templates)

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Simplified Navigation**: 3 main sections vs 6 complex layers
2. **Condensed Content**: Essential information only, no verbose explanations
3. **AI-Optimized**: Structure designed for AI agent consumption
4. **Maintainable**: Easier to update and maintain
5. **Scalable**: Can grow without becoming convoluted

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Structure setup and content migration
- **Week 2**: Content condensation and optimization
- **Week 3**: Testing, validation, and cleanup
- **Week 4**: Final validation and documentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All critical information preserved in new structure
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive and logical
- [ ] Content is concise and AI-optimized
- [ ] No broken links or missing references
- [ ] AI agents can effectively use new structure
- [ ] Documentation is easier to maintain and update
