# AI Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL: All project documentation must follow these principles:**

## Core Principles

- **Assume AI Intelligence** - Cursor knows common concepts; only document what's unique to your project
- **Be Concise** - Every sentence must add value; skip obvious explanations

## What NOT to Document

- Universal programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Standard framework features (React components, API endpoints)
- Obvious implementation details (error handling, validation)
- Common best practices (code organization, naming conventions)

## What TO Document

- Project-specific business logic and requirements
- Custom implementations and architectural decisions
- Integration patterns unique to your system
- Domain-specific terminology and concepts

## Enforcement

All AI agents must follow these standards when generating or updating project documentation.
