# Project Adaptations

Official procedure for creating project-specific overrides within the meta documentation system.

## Purpose

Adaptations exist to provide project autonomy and flexibility while maintaining system-wide consistency. Projects may customize templates, naming conventions, and structural elements to meet specific requirements without altering global foundations.

## Scope

**What Can Be Adapted:**
- Template structures and content sections
- Naming conventions and file organization
- Documentation layer structure (with justification)
- Cross-reference patterns and relationships
- AI prompt customization and specialization

**What Cannot Be Adapted:**
- Core philosophical principles from Foundations
- Governance rules and amendment procedures
- Meta system constitutional authority
- Universal template compliance requirements
- Cross-project interoperability standards

## Process

1. **Documentation** - Project must document the proposed adaptation with clear rationale
2. **Review** - Adaptation must be reviewed for compliance with meta system principles
3. **Approval** - Adaptation must be approved by project maintainers and documented
4. **Declaration** - Adaptation must be declared using the official format
5. **Validation** - Adaptation must be validated against meta system requirements

## Declaration Format

Projects must use the following template when defining an override:

```markdown
## Adaptation Declaration
**Project:** [Project Name]
**Adaptation Type:** [Template Override/Structure Change/Naming Convention/etc.]
**Affected File:** [Path to affected meta file or component]
**Reason:** [Clear justification for the adaptation]
**Scope:** [What is being changed and what remains unchanged]
**Approved By:** [Name/AI version/date]
**Validation:** [How the adaptation maintains meta system compliance]
```

## Example Declaration

```markdown

**Affected File:** /meta/1-Frameworks/prd-template.md
**Reason:** Added "Localization" section for international market requirements
**Scope:** Extended PRD template with localization requirements while preserving core structure
**Approved By:** Project Lead / AI v2.1 / 2024-12-19
