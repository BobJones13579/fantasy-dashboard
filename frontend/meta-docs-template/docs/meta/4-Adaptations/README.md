# Adaptations

The Adaptations layer defines how specific projects can safely customize or override global meta rules while preserving system-wide consistency and legality within the AI-Native Meta Documentation System.

## Purpose

Adaptations serve as the "local government" of the meta system, allowing projects to define their own naming conventions, structure adjustments, or rule exceptions through clearly documented override procedures. This layer enables project autonomy and flexibility while maintaining the constitutional authority of the global meta system.

## Core Components

- **[Project Adaptations](project-adaptations.md)** - Official procedure for creating project-specific overrides and customizations
- **[Naming Conventions](naming-conventions.md)** - Naming rules for documents, prompts, and folders with override mechanisms

## Authority Statement

Local adaptations must declare scope, justification, and points of divergence from the core meta constitution. All project-level customizations must be documented through the established adaptation procedures to maintain system integrity and traceability.
