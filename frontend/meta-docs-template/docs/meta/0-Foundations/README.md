# Foundations

The Foundations layer represents the constitutional core of the AI-Native Meta Documentation System. This layer establishes the fundamental principles, definitions, and structural specifications that govern all documentation within the meta system.

## Overview

Foundations serves as the system kernel, containing only conceptual and definitional material that provides the philosophical and structural foundation for all other layers. These documents define the immutable rules and principles that ensure consistency, clarity, and AI-readability across the entire documentation ecosystem.

## Core Documents

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Must Read First)
- **[Philosophy](philosophy.md)** - Constitutional axioms and core principles governing the meta system
- **[AI Behavior Protocols](../2-Operations/ai-behavior-protocols.md)** - **MANDATORY** behavioral laws and safety protocols for AI collaboration
- **[Risk Management](../2-Operations/risk-management.md)** - **MANDATORY** guardrails for preventing catastrophes in AI-assisted development

### ðŸŸ¡ ESSENTIAL (Core Framework)
- **[Documentation Layer Specification](docs-layer-spec.md)** - Canonical structure and requirements for the `/docs` layer
- **[Glossary of Meta Terms](glossary-of-meta-terms.md)** - Essential terminology and definitions for the meta system
- **[Definitions](definitions.md)** - File types, formats, and conceptual definitions used throughout the system

### ðŸŸ¢ SUPPORTING (Reference Material)
- **[Implementation Guides](implementation-guides.md)** - Scale-specific guidance for applying the meta system
- **[Project Context Template](project-context-template.md)** - Structured template for capturing comprehensive project information
- **[Project Initialization Workflow](project-initialization-workflow.md)** - Step-by-step guide for initializing new projects with proper context capture

## System Dependencies

All other layers in the meta system depend on Foundations for their structural and conceptual framework. The 1-Frameworks layer implements templates based on these foundations, the 2-Operations layer applies these principles to automation workflows, the 3-Governance layer maintains compliance with these standards, and the 4-Adaptations layer provides project-specific overrides while respecting the foundational principles.

Foundations documents serve as the authoritative reference for AI agents and human operators, ensuring consistent interpretation and application of meta system principles across all documentation activities.
