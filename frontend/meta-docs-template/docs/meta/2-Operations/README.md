# Operations

The Operations layer governs how the AI executes, generates, and maintains knowledge within the AI-Native Meta Documentation System. This layer serves as the "executive branch" of the meta constitution, translating constitutional intent from Foundations and Frameworks into executable AI behavior.

## Purpose

Operations defines how the system functions in practice: how AI behaves, how documents are generated or updated, and how orchestration chains work. This layer ensures that the philosophical principles and template frameworks established in earlier layers are consistently applied through predictable, automated processes.

## Core Components

- **[AI Behavior Protocols](ai-behavior-protocols.md)** - Behavioral laws and code of conduct for AI collaboration
- **[Risk Management](risk-management.md)** - Comprehensive guardrails for AI-assisted development and system safety
- **[Task Management](task-management.md)** - Structured approach to breaking down complex features into verifiable tasks
- **[Orchestration Guide](orchestration-guide.md)** - How multiple prompts interact as chains and execution flows
- **[Generation Rules](generation-rules.md)** - Deterministic generation logic, naming conventions, and overwrite policies
- **[Chain Prompts](chain-prompts/)** - Reusable operational workflows for common documentation tasks

## System Function

The Operations layer ensures consistency between human intent, meta frameworks, and AI execution by providing clear behavioral protocols, orchestration patterns, and generation rules that govern all automated documentation processes.
