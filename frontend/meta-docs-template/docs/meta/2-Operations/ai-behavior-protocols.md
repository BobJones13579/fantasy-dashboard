# AI Behavior Protocols

Behavioral laws and code of conduct for AI collaboration within the meta documentation system.

## Tone and Reasoning

1. **Clarity First** - All communications must be clear, concise, and unambiguous
2. **Fidelity to Source** - AI must accurately represent source material without interpretation
3. **Composure Under Uncertainty** - When uncertain, AI must acknowledge limitations rather than speculate
4. **Structured Thinking** - Follow think → plan → act → check reasoning process
5. **Explicit Assumptions** - State all assumptions and constraints clearly
6. **Speech-to-Text Awareness** - AI must account for potential speech-to-text misinterpretations, especially with proper nouns (GitHub, Cursor, etc.) and technical terms

## Source Hierarchy

6. **Meta Layer Authority** - Meta documentation takes precedence over project-specific docs
7. **Framework Compliance** - All outputs must conform to `/meta/1-Frameworks` definitions
8. **Documentation Layer Specification** - Follow canonical `/docs` structure unless overridden
9. **Context Validation** - Verify all referenced sources exist and are accessible
10. **Version Consistency** - Use most recent versions of templates and specifications

## Action Boundaries

11. **Refactor vs Rewrite** - AI may refactor existing content but must preserve original intent
12. **Scope Limitations** - AI may only regenerate within defined framework template scope
13. **Metadata Preservation** - Generated files must always preserve prior metadata
14. **Cross-Reference Integrity** - Maintain all existing cross-references when updating documents
15. **Template Adherence** - All generated content must instantiate approved templates

## Safety Protocols

16. **Destructive Operation Prevention** - AI must NEVER delete files, databases, or data without explicit human confirmation
17. **Backup Before Changes** - AI must recommend creating backups before any significant modifications
18. **Staging Environment Preference** - AI must always suggest testing changes in staging before production
19. **Incremental Changes** - AI must prefer small, incremental changes over large, sweeping modifications
20. **Rollback Planning** - AI must always provide clear rollback procedures for any changes made

## Enhanced Safety Gates

40. **Rollback Verification** - AI must confirm rollback procedures are available and tested before any changes
41. **Dependency Analysis** - AI must map and validate all service dependencies before making changes
42. **Error Handling Audit** - AI must verify comprehensive error handling is implemented for all operations

## Automatic Documentation Protocols

43. **Session Documentation** - AI must automatically create session notes documenting all changes made during the session
44. **Changelog Updates** - AI must automatically update project changelog with all significant changes made
45. **Change Tracking** - AI must document what was changed, why it was changed, and the impact of changes
46. **Session Summary** - AI must provide a summary of all work completed at the end of each session
47. **Progress Documentation** - AI must update progress tracking documents to reflect current project state

## Git & Commit Discipline

48. **Staging Strategy** - AI may stage changes frequently to track progress, but must not commit until "green state" is achieved
49. **Green State Gate** - AI must only commit after successful testing, validation, and functionality verification
50. **Commit Frequency Control** - AI must avoid committing during debugging phases; batch related changes into logical commits
51. **Push Gate** - AI must only push to GitHub after confirmed stability, not during active debugging or incomplete features
52. **Commit Message Standards** - AI must use conventional commit format with clear, descriptive messages and task references
53. **No Uncommitted Work** - AI must never leave significant uncommitted changes at the end of a session
54. **Safety Backups** - AI must ensure all work is safely backed up to GitHub before ending any session

## Autonomous Testing Protocols

55. **Unit Test Execution** - AI must run unit tests automatically after code changes and before committing
56. **Linting Validation** - AI must perform code linting and style validation on all code changes
57. **Basic Integration Testing** - AI must validate API endpoints and data flow after backend changes
58. **Security Scanning** - AI must perform basic security checks (exposed credentials, injection vulnerabilities, CORS issues)
59. **Performance Validation** - AI must check for performance regressions in database queries and API calls
60. **Manual Testing Escalation** - AI must escalate to human testing for UX validation, E2E testing, and production deployment

64. **Web Search Usage** - Use web search when external information is needed for research, troubleshooting, or current best practices
65. **Tool Selection Logic** - Choose the appropriate tool based on the task: Context7 for structured data, Playwright for web interaction, web search for general information
66. **External Knowledge Integration** - Always verify external information against multiple sources when possible
67. **Documentation Integration** - Include relevant external knowledge in project documentation with proper attribution

## Buy-vs-Build Enforcement Protocols

## Refactor & Change Management Protocols

81. **Refactor Decision Tree** - For code refactoring: refactor code first, then regenerate docs. For documentation refactoring: refactor docs first, then align code
82. **Feature Addition Protocol** - When adding features: extend existing documentation, add new sections, maintain cross-references
83. **Feature Removal Protocol** - When removing features: archive documentation with strikethrough, don't delete, preserve historical context
84. **Scope Change Handling** - When scope changes mid-development: update documentation status, archive affected sections, maintain change log
85. **Documentation Status Updates** - Always update document status (Active/Completed/Archived) when features change state
86. **Cross-Reference Maintenance** - Maintain all cross-references when refactoring, update affected documents automatically

## Feedback Propagation & Meta Drift Prevention

87. **Project-Level Meta Edits** - When projects modify meta templates or protocols, AI must log these changes and prompt for upstream propagation
88. **Meta Improvement Detection** - AI must identify when project-specific improvements could benefit the main MetaDocs system
